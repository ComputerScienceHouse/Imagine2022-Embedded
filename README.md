This repo contains all source code and information pertaining to the configuration and operation of the embedded portion of CSHacked. It boots up, tries to create a mesh network with nearby ESPs, then scans for [tags](https://github.com/ComputerScienceHouse/Imagine2022-Tags). When it finds one, it uploads signal and timestamp data to the [ingestion](https://github.com/ComputerScienceHouse/Imagine2022-Ingestion) server for processing.

Below, you'll find some (slightly modified) documentation from the repo this project was pulled from.

| Supported Targets | ESP32 |
| ----------------- | ----- |

This project is based off of the [ESP-IDF BT-INQUIRY demo](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/v4.3.2/examples/bluetooth/bluedroid/classic_bt/bt_discovery)

Demo of Classic Bluetooth Device and Service Discovery. Performs inquiry to search for devices, relays names, MAC addresses, and RSSI to the screen.

## How to use

Install script automatically flashes and device and increments device number. Must be run in project directory (outside container)
```
python3 incflash.py
```


### Hardware Required

This example is designed to run on commonly available ESP32 development board, e.g. ESP32-DevKitC.

### Configure the project

```
idf.py menuconfig
```

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run the monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(Replace PORT with the name of the serial port to use. For example, /dev/ttyUSB0)

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

## Troubleshooting

- Some old BT devices don't place their device name in EIR. Users can obtain the peer device name in `bt_app_gap_cb` `ESP_BT_GAP_DISC_RES_EVT` event handler or resolve it in EIR as in the function `get_name_from_eir`.

- The ESP32 places its device name in EIR by default.
